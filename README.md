## Finding my classroom

This is a VR application to simulate a scenario 
where a new student is about to go to class but doesnâ€™t know how 
to get there. The app will provide the student with instructions 
and challenges to let them find their classroom. This application 
could potentially provide schools with a solution to allow their 
students to know the location of a specific room before
physically being there. 

### How to install
First, download the apk file "find my classroom.apk" , and use SideQuest to sideload 
the application onto your Oculus Quest. Please follow this tutorial to know how to 
use SideQuest: https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/.
